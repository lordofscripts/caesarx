go-carousel (1.1.0-RC4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

 * GH-007 Refactored AffineHelper, IKeySequencer and AffineSequencer in order to
   add binary file encryption support for Affine cipher.
 * Added CRC64 to cmn for future use in binary header and tests
 * GH-002 Binary File Encryption support for ALL ciphers now (Affine included).

go-carousel (1.1.0-RC3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

## Improvements
  * GH-003 Debian package build support (Makefile)
  * GH-005 Core improvements to support binary encryption.
  * GH-006 Support for Text File round-trip Encryption for all variants
  * Test cases for Text File Encryption and new core library functions
  * Test cases for Command-Line Applications to ensure advertised parameter
    and option combinations work as intended by checking exit code.
  * Documented MLog (app/mlog) package and added mlog.At() variadic tag.
  * `IKeySequencer.Feedback()` now returns `error` rather than panicking
    so that the algorithm driver can pinpoint the message location.
  * GH-008 Binary file encryption supported for Caesar, Didimus, Fibonacci,
    and Bellaso.

## Fixed Bugs
  * GH-001 CLI applications not working for -list, -version and -help CLI options
  * GH-009 VigenereSequencer panics. It now returns errors and lets the upper layer
    turn into fatality but with more forensic info available.
  * GH-011 GitHub workflow fix (v1.1.0-RC3)

## Known Bugs

  * GH-007 A minor refactoring needed to fully support binary encryption on all.
  * GH-010 Sporadic Vigen√®re binary file encryption failure
