Description: Modern version of ancient mono/polyalphabetic ciphers
 Do you like cryptography and want to get back to basics? Or perhaps
 you are curious or a newbie that wants to see how it all began?.
 It started back in the times of Julius Caesar. But this package
 contains modern versions capable of working with modern-day
 unicode alphabets and more. It includes Caesar, Didimus, Fibonacci,
 Bellaso, Vigen√®re and Affine ciphers.
